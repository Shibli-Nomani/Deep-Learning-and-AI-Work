### üåµ Nature of objects in Computer Vision
`Static Computer Vision:`

Static computer vision deals with objects or scenes that are not changing over time. Example: Image-based object recognition

`Dynamic Computer Vision:`

Dynamic computer vision involves objects in real-time or scenes that are changing or moving over time. Example: Video-based tracking of moving objects, vehicles in traffic surveillance, tracking a person's motion in a sports game.
