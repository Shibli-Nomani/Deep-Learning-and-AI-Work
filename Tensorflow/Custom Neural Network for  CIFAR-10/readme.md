# ðŸ”® About Dataset and visualization
CIFAR-10 is a well-known benchmark dataset in machine learning and computer vision. It consists of 60,000 color images, each 32x32 pixels in size, categorized into 10 different classes. These classes include common objects and animals. CIFAR-10 is often used for tasks like image classification and object recognition, making it a standard dataset for evaluating and testing machine learning and deep learning models.

### ðŸ“Œ note: 
This code defines, trains, and evaluates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification:

Model Definition: The model consists of convolutional layers for feature extraction, followed by dense layers for classification. Input images are processed through convolution and pooling layers.

Model Compilation: The model is configured with the Adam optimizer and Sparse Categorical Cross-Entropy loss for multi-class classification.

Model Training: It's trained on training data (train_images and train_labels) for 10 epochs, with validation on test data (test_images and test_labels).

Model Evaluation: After training, the model's accuracy and loss are evaluated on the test data. Training and validation accuracy are plotted over epochs.
