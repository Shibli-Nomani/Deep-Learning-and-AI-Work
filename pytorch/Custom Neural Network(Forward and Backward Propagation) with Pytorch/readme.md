### ðŸŒ… Implementation of Neural Network with Pytorch

`Neural Network:` A computational model inspired by the human brain that learns to make predictions from data through layers of interconnected artificial neurons.

`weight :` In machine learning, a weight is a parameter that determines the strength of the connection between neurons in a neural network, affecting the importance of input features in making predictions.

`bias:` Think of bias as the "base value" in a machine learning model. It's like an initial guess that the model starts with before learning from data.

### ðŸ“Œ note: 

The provided code defines and trains a simple neural network for regression using PyTorch, optimizing with mean squared error and stochastic gradient descent, and then prints the model's predictions and parameter gradients.
